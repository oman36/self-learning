# Packages support one more special attribute, __path__. This is initialized to be a list containing the name of the
# directory holding the packageâ€™s __init__.py before the code in that file is executed. This variable can be
# modified; doing so affects future searches for modules and subpackages contained in the package.
#
# While this feature is not often needed, it can be used to extend the set of modules found in a package.
